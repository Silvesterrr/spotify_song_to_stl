# Example
You start by copying spotify song url as below.

Than you run python file from console <br>
`spotify_song_to_stl.py spotify:track:5W3cjX2J3tjhG8zb6u0qHn 1 4.5`  
Number 1 is height of only code and 4.5 is height of base. So full height will be 5.5 (Unit is mm obviously) <br>
And after this we get something like this:<br>
